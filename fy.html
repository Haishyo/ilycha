    <p>And I just wanted to say that even tho we barely talk in person I still love you very very much and admire u so much. And no. I'm not lying. I never lied about love and having feelings for you, you're the only girl to make me feel this way and I really really want another shot. what I did was dumb and uncalled for and I admit it, and I am so so sorry so please.. just please. will you give it a 3rd shot? I respect your decision either way btw :)</p>
